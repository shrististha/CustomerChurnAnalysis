## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the essential steps of data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis on a Telecom Customer Churn dataset. The primary goal is to transform raw, and often messy, data into a clean, well-structured, and reliable format suitable for advanced analytics, visualization, and machine learning modeling. The process involves handling missing values, correcting data types, standardizing categorical features, and ensuring data integrity.

## Datasets
This project utilizes the following dataset:

**Customer Churn Dataset (CustomerChurnDataset.xlsx):** Contains customer data for a telecom company, including services subscribed to, tenure, charges, and churn status. This dataset suffered from incorrect data types, inconsistent categorical values, and missing information that required imputation.

## Tools & Technologies
The analysis was conducted using Python and the following libraries:
*   **pandas:** For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations and handling missing `NaN` values.
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** As the interactive environment for coding and analysis.
